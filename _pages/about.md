Hi! I'm a nerd who likes exploring and building things. While my undergraduate degree was in physics and computer science, I've been slowly turning into an engineer. If I'm not working or tinkering with some project, I enjoy hiking, canyoning, board games, tabletop RPGs, and playing music.

This website shows off some projects I've worked on, as well as various other things I find interesting.

If you're interested in hiring me, you can download my resume [here](<../assets/documents/resume - Perrin Waldock.pdf>).
