I'm a former physicist, currently working in engineering. This website shows off some of the projects I've worked on, as well as various other things I find interesting.

When I'm not working or tinkering on a project, I enjoy hiking, canyoning, board games, tabletop RPGs, and playing music.

If you're interested in hiring me, [here](<../assets/documents/resume - Perrin Waldock.pdf>) is my CV.
